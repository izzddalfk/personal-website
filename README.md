## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                           |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 🚀 Deployment

This website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. When you push to the `main` or `master` branch, the site will be built and deployed.

### GitHub Pages Configuration

1. The `astro.config.mjs` file has been configured for GitHub Pages:

   - `site` is set to the GitHub Pages URL
   - `base` is set to the repository name

2. A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to:
   - Build the site with Astro
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### GitHub Repository Setup

To complete the deployment setup:

1. Push this project to GitHub
2. Go to your repository's "Settings" tab
3. Navigate to "Pages" section
4. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
5. Your site will be deployed at `https://[username].github.io/personal-website/`
